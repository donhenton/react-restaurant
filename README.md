###Notes###

* http://babeljs.io/repl/ to see react/babel snippets translated.
* Simple server runs on http://127.0.0.1:8080 **NOT** localhost
* react-postal tag uses postal instead of Redux
* The main branch uses react, redux, and a dispatcher
 

###Demonstrations###

The menu-branch contains simple examples of react and component communication


###Running and Developing###
* gulp task 'dev' sets up system for local development
* gulp task 'release' packages assets for placement into production. The html
